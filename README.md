# Loan Default Prediction

## Introduction

Loan default prediction is a critical tool for financial institutions to assess the creditworthiness of borrowers. By predicting the likelihood of default, banks and lenders can make informed decisions, minimize risks, and improve profitability. This project utilizes machine learning to build a robust prediction system for classifying loans as defaults or non-defaults.

## What We Have Done

1. **Data Preprocessing**: 
   - Cleaned and transformed the data, handling both numerical and categorical features.
   - Applied scaling and encoding techniques for efficient model training.

2. **Modeling**:
   - Implemented multiple machine learning models: Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosting.
   - Evaluated models using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and ROC AUC score.

3. **Model Evaluation**:
   - Assessed model performance with comprehensive classification reports and confusion matrices.
   - Identified the best-performing model based on cross-validation and test set results.

4. **Modular Design**:
   - Developed a reusable pipeline for data preprocessing, training, testing, and prediction.

## What Can Be Improved

1. **User Interface**:
   - A user-friendly interface can be developed using **Streamlit** or **Flask** to make the system accessible for non-technical users.

2. **Data Visualization**:
   - Integrate visualizations to better understand data patterns and model performance.

3. **Deployment**:
   - Deploy the model as a web application or API to enable real-time predictions.

4. **Feature Engineering**:
   - Incorporate additional features, such as macroeconomic indicators, for improved prediction accuracy.
